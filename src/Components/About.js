        Hi, I'm Alan, Brazilian, Curious, Creative and a Passionate Full Stack Software Engineer.<br></br>
Why passionate? <br></br>
I love how fast the technology advances and allows us to learn, improve, expand and do it all over 
again with a new design 10x more efficient than it was the last summer.<br></br>
<br></br>
I started my degree in Computer Science but its on hold at the moment.
I have completed a Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
Currently in the process of going through a JavaScript course on Udemy and learning 
MongoDB and other technologies.<br></br>
<br></br>
Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity not only to show what I can do, but also how fast I can learn and develop 
new skills.<br></br>
I bring a set of talents, dedication, passion and a customer oriented background that will be proven 
beneficial for this role.<br></br>
<br></br>
Please review my resume for a full descripton of my skills.<br></br>
<br></br>
I look forward to discussing how my capabilities 
can fit your team. <br></br>
